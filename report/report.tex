\begin{abstract}
	For our EE201 final Verilog project, we implemented pitch shifting on the FPGA. We wrote a 1024-point Radix-2 Decimation
	in Time Fast Fourier Transform module, which we integrated into a phase vocoder.  The phase vocoder allows us to do
	the actual pitch shifting. The device accepts a WAV file through FileIO and shifts the pitch based on the values of the 
	switches.  It then returns the shifted file to the computer.

\section{Introduction}
  The phase vocoder has many uses in the music industry, both as a correction tool and as an audio effect.
  When combined with a pitch detection algorithm, it can shift the input signal to the nearest whole pitch, an effect known as auto-tuning.
  If the shift can be performed in under 50 milliseconds, the delay won't be perceptible and can be used for live performances \cite{bib:guitarpitchshifter}.

\section{Radix-2 DIT FFT}
  The first component we had to create was the Fast Fourier Transform. The FFT takes a discrete signal in the time domain and 
  transforms it into the frequency domain. For our device we need a 1024 point FFT.
  \subsection{Relevant Theory}
  The Discrete Fourier Transform is shown below.
  \begin{equation}
  	X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\frac{2 \pi j}{N} k n} \quad \quad k = 0, \dots, N-1
  	\label{eqn:dft}
  \end{equation}
  
  However, the number of operations required scales as $N^2$ and the DFT becomes very expensive at 1024 points.
  The Cooley Tukey Algorithm is an Fast Fourier Transform, which reduces the number of operations \cite{bib:ctdft}.
  \begin{equation}
  	 X_k  =	 \sum \limits_{m=0}^{N/2-1} x_{2m}     e^{-\frac{2\pi j}{N} (2m)k}\\   +  \sum \limits_{m=0}^{N/2-1} x_{2m+1} e^{-\frac{2\pi j}{N} (2m+1)k}
  	\label{eqn:ctdft}
  \end{equation} 
  
  \subsection{Hardware Implementation}
  Because the number of points is a power of two, we can use Radix-2 Decimation in Time.
  The Cooley Tukey Algorithm can be applied recursively until the size of the FFT is 2.  
  The dataflow for our algorithm is shown in figure \ref{fig:butterfly}.  Each column
  is called a pass, each set of interlocked rows in the pass is a block, and each pair of lines is called a 
  butterfly (after the appearance of crossing lines).
  \begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=75mm]{images/butterfly.pdf}
  \caption{Dataflow of radix-2 DIT FFT \cite{bib:butterfly}. $W_k^n$ represents the Twiddle factor $e^{-\frac{2\pi j}{N}kn}$.}  
  \label{fig:butterfly}
  \end{figure}
  
  We have chosen this algorithm for the substantial savings in operations. The number of complex multiplies and adds in
  the Radix-2 DIT FFT scales as $Nlog(N)$. In theory, a 1024 point DFT requires 1048576 multiplies while the FFT uses 
  only 5120 \cite{bib:fftdit}.
  
  The FFT requires us to compute a complex exponential, which can be expressed as a sine and cosine.  One option would be to 
  implement CORDIC for calculating trigonometric functions.  However, the exponential is a function of only current indexes.  
  Therefore, we implemented it as a look up table with 512 elements (the function is symmetric).  The elements in the LUT
  are called Twiddle Factors. 
  
  Another feature of this implementation is the bit re-ordering, as shown in the figure. Because the algorithm computes the
  FFT in-place, we must re-order the input data.  On software systems this is less desirable but in hardware we can do this
  in one clock or re-index our data.  The re-ordered index is simply the old order backwards in binary.  As such, 
  \lstinline!10'b0000000001! becomes \lstinline!10'b1000000000!, or \lstinline!10'd512!.
  
  
  
  \subsection{The Inverse Transform}
    After manipulating the signal in the frequency domain, we must transform back into the time domain for playback. 
    Rather than implementing a separate IFFT module, we can reuse the FFT module.  We simply switch the real and imaginary
    inputs and divide the final result, which will be located in the imaginary data, by 1024.

\section{Phase Vocoder}
  The most basic way of shifting pitch is to simply speedup or slowdown the playback. For instance, we can shift the pitch
  by one octave if we playback twice as fast.  
  However, this is undesirable because the duration will now be twice as short.  
  The phase vocoder allows us to change the pitch of a signal without affecting speed.
  It makes use of the Short-Time Fourier Transform to analyze a segment of the input signal, scales the frequencies accordingly,
  and outputs the modified signal using the overlap-add method. The process is shown in figure \ref{fig:vocoder}.
  \begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=75mm]{images/vocoder.png}
  \caption{Processes involved in a phase vocoder \cite{bib:guitarpitchshifter}.}  
  \label{fig:vocoder}
  \end{figure}
  
  However, this technique introduces audio artifacts at the edges of overlaps.  Therefore, we also multiply our input
  segment with a Hanning window, which is a cosine function that resembles a bell curve.  This helps smooth the output
  signal.

\section{Interface}
  We receive WAV audio using FileIO provided by the TAs. On the board we provide switches to specify the amount of shift
  and we use the seven segment display to show the current state.
  
  \subsection{WAV Audio}
  WAV audio is a RIFF bitstream format.  As such there are various ways to configure a WAV audiostream \cite{bib:wav}. 
  For our device we have chosen to accept a mono 16-bit PCM WAV audio file with a sampling rate of 44.1 kilosamples per second.
  The data headers go from byte 0 to byte 43 and the data starts at byte 44.  The audio data is in the little endian byte order.

\section{Conclusion}
We have created a simple phase vocoder in Verilog. There are many possible uses for such a device that can be achieved
with minor modifications. A basic guitar pitch shifting pedal can be made if the effect can be applied live. 
To increase the speed of the process, we can add more Butterfly units to reduce the amount of time needed in the FFT.  
If we add a pitch detector, we can create an auto-tuner.
